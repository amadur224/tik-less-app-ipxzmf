You want to create a mobile application similar to TikTok, but without the messaging feature. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Video Feed:** Implement a core video feed where users can scroll through short videos, similar to TikTok's \"For You\" page.\n*   **Video Upload:** Allow users to upload their own videos to the platform.\n*   **User Profiles:** Create user profiles where users can view their uploaded videos and other profile information.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F9F9F9` (Light gray)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray)\n    *   Primary: `#FF4081` (Pink)\n    *   Secondary: `#64B5F6` (Light blue)\n    *   Accent: `#FFD740` (Yellow)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#BBDEFB` (Very light blue)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify the Home Screen:** The current `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file seems to be the main screen. I will need to modify this to display the video feed.\n2.  **Implement Video Upload:** Add a button or a new tab for video uploads. This will likely involve creating a new component and integrating it into the app's navigation.\n3.  **Create User Profiles:** Modify the `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` file to display user-specific content.\n4.  **Remove Messaging Functionality:** Since the user explicitly requested the removal of messaging, I will need to identify and remove any components or code related to messaging. Based on the file list provided, there don't seem to be any messaging components, so this step might not require any changes.\n5.  **Remove modalDemos array:** Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\nOkay, I have a plan. I will now instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-23T18:51:18.397852"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a TikTok-like application without messaging!
